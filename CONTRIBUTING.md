# Milely Team Norms

## Workflow 

* Team meetings are scheduled through our Discord channel where members will look at the class schedule and discuss/assign work as needed to meet deadlines and overall project goals. 
* Team will meet during specified Project Work class sessions alongside previously scheduled meetings before deadlines. 

## Rules

* Use our given Discord channel to communicate often with fellow team members to ensure everyone is made aware of their own responsibilities and any potential changes/problems arisen.
* Members will communicate to the team any changes, updates, commits made to the project beforehand in the Discord channel.

## Setup

* Currently, as there is little code in the project, a typical Git cloning operation will allow it and its files to work on your machine. 

## Conflict Resolution

### In the event of conflict regarding individual group members, these are the steps the team will follow:

1. First, we will attempt to address the conflict involved team member directly as a team. This involves reaching out on Discord, both through the team channel and potentially via Direct Message, to make them aware of the situation and attempt resolution.

2. Should resolution not occur before the next team meeting, the following will occur: 

    * The situation will be reported to the project management. (Professor and Course Administrators)
    * The responsibilities held by the conflict involved team member will be distributed to the rest of the team.
    * One or more team members will make an effort to keep the non-participating team member up to date on project progress via the team Discord channel or Direct Message.
    * The other team will best accomodate the reintroduction of the non-participating team member to the project's workflow should they decide to pursue such action.
    * The team will not wait longer than TWO team meetings worth of time for a non-participating teammate to complete their assignments.
